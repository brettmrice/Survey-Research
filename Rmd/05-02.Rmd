# **Reliability & Validity Assessment** {-}

After designing your survey and collecting the data, it's tempting to jump straight into analyzing frequencies and means. However, a critical preliminary step in data analysis is to ask a fundamental question: Does our survey instrument actually work? In other words, are we confident that the data we collected is both consistent and accurate? This is the domain of reliability and validity assessment. These two concepts are the bedrock of sound survey research. Without them, even the most sophisticated statistical analysis can produce meaningless or misleading results

Think of it like using a bathroom scale. If you step on it three times in a row and get three wildly different readings (150 lbs, 195 lbs, 120 lbs), the scale is not **reliable**. Its measurements are inconsistent. Now, imagine you step on it three times and get the exact same reading each time: 250 lbs. This scale is highly reliable—it's consistent. However, if you know your true weight is around 170 lbs, the scale is not **valid**. It consistently gives you the wrong information. A good survey, like a good scale, must be both reliable (consistent) and valid (accurate)

## **Reliability: The Consistency of Measurement** {-}

Reliability is concerned with the consistency and stability of your measurement tool. If you were to administer your survey to the same group of people under the same conditions at two different times, would you get similar results? Reliability helps us trust that the scores generated by our survey are not due to random chance or fluke occurrences. While there are several statistical methods to assess reliability, one of the most common for survey scales is a measure of internal consistency

**Cronbach's Alpha (α)** is a statistic used to assess the internal consistency of a set of survey questions (often called a "scale" or "index") designed to measure a single underlying concept. Conceptually, it tells you how closely related a set of items are as a group. Imagine you have five questions designed to measure "Job Satisfaction." If the scale has high internal consistency, respondents who are satisfied with their job should, on average, answer all five questions in a similar "satisfied" manner. Cronbach’s Alpha essentially calculates the average correlation among all the items in the scale. A high Alpha score suggests the items are all tapping into the same latent construct and are effectively "hanging together." A low score suggests the items are not measuring the same thing, and the scale may be an unreliable mix of unrelated questions

## **Validity: The Accuracy of Measurement** {-}

While reliability is about consistency, validity is about truthfulness or accuracy. It addresses the question: Are we truly measuring the concept we intend to measure? A survey might be perfectly reliable but could be measuring something other than what the researcher thinks it is. Establishing validity is often more complex than establishing reliability, as it involves accumulating evidence to support the interpretation of the survey scores. There are several forms of validity, each providing a different type of evidence

### **Face Validity** {-}

This is the most basic and informal type of validity. It simply asks: At a glance, does the survey appear to measure what it's supposed to measure? For example, a survey designed to measure dietary habits that asks questions about fruit and vegetable consumption has high face validity. It's an intuitive, "on the face of it" assessment made by non-experts or experts alike. While it's a good starting point, it is considered the weakest form of evidence because it relies on subjective judgment rather than empirical data

### **Content Validity** {-}

This is a more systematic assessment of whether a survey covers all the relevant dimensions of the concept it aims to measure. It goes beyond face validity by seeking expert judgment. To establish content validity, you would ask subject matter experts to review your survey items and assess whether they are comprehensive and representative of the concept. For instance, a survey measuring "Burnout" would need to have questions covering all its core components—emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a diminished sense of personal accomplishment—not just one of them. If key aspects are missing, the survey lacks content validity

### **Construct Validity** {-}

This is arguably the most important and sophisticated form of validity. It focuses on whether the scores from your survey behave in a way that is consistent with the theoretical understanding of the construct you are measuring. It’s not a single test but a body of evidence. For example, if you create a new survey scale to measure "Self-Esteem," you would need to show that scores on your scale correlate positively with scores on other established measures of self-esteem (convergent validity) and do not correlate with measures of unrelated concepts like intelligence (discriminant validity). By demonstrating these expected patterns of relationships, you provide strong evidence that your survey is truly measuring the theoretical construct of self-esteem

In summary, before you can confidently report on your survey's findings, you must first build a case that your data is trustworthy. Reliability ensures your instrument produces stable and consistent results, with Cronbach's Alpha being a key indicator for internal consistency. Validity ensures your instrument is accurate and measures the intended concept, with evidence built through assessments of its face, content, and construct validity. Together, they form the foundation upon which all meaningful data analysis is built
